# Rover_Intersection_Challenge
This readme will help you understand how the program works and how to run the program.

## How to run the program:
I have writen this program using Python. To run the program please make sure that you have a Python compiler installed on your device. If you do not have a Python compiler you can download one here https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once you downloaded Python you should also add the Python add-on to your IDE, if you do not already have it.

To run the code please make sure that the text file, name input.txt is in the same folder as the Rover_Chalenge.py, the program wil not work if the text file and the .py file is not in the same file. All you now have to do is prease run and you will get the results in the termenal of the IDE that you are using.
